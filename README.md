# Lecturemon Frontend
Built with love by Noah and Kai in react.

## Installation
If you aren't already using the prebuild server and app repo then do the following:
1. Run `yarn install` or `npm install`
2. Build the project via `craco build`
3. Serve the contents of the `build` folder by copying its contents into the static folder of the backend node server
4. Enjoy

### Tailwind Errors
If you get any errors about tailwind not being installed then please use the suggested command to install it

## Advice
Whilst building both the frontend and backend yourself allows more control, we suggest that you just pull the complete package repo which you can then just run the node server and have everything that currently works work.
